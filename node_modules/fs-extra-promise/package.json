  "readme": "# fs-extra-promise.js\n\n# Node file system library and fs-extra module promisified with bluebird\n\n## Current status\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fs-extra-promise.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra-promise)\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/master.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise)\n[![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise.svg)](https://david-dm.org/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise)\n[![Dev dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/dev/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise.svg)](https://david-dm.org/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise)\n\nAPI is stable. No tests at present but it seems to work fine!\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module is a drop-in replacement for the [native node file system module](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) and the augmented [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.org/package/fs-extra) module.\n\nAdditionally, it creates promisified versions of all fs's and fs-extra's async methods, using [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bluebird). These methods are named the same as the original fs/fs-extra methods with 'Async' added to the end of the methods.\n\nSo instead of:\n\n\tvar fs = require('fs');\n\tfs.readFile(path, function(err, data) {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t});\n\nYou can now:\n\n\tvar fs = require('fs-extra-promise');\n\tfs.readFileAsync(path).then(function(data) {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t});\n\nAll original fs and fs-extra methods are included unmodified.\n\n### isDirectory() methods\n\nFor convenience, additional methods `isDirectory()`, `isDirectorySync()` and `isDirectoryAsync()` are provided.\n\nThese are are shortcuts for doing `fs.stat()` followed by running `isDirectory()` on the result returned by `stat()`.\n\n## Tests\n\nUse `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.\n\nThere aren't any tests at present, except for running jshint on the code.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee changelog.md\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you discover a bug, please raise an issue on Github. https://github.com/overlookmotel/fs-extra-promise/issues\n",
